The Arqivist is an app integrating Confluence and Slack,
letting you create pages from Slack messages,
It can also backup messages and files to Google Drive (more soon), either once or continuously on a schedule.

## Use-cases

* **Creating ad-hoc documentation** — No docs? No problem! Ask in Slack and then create a Confluence page with the answer!
* **Incident management** — Create a dedicated channel for an incident, and save the whole discussion for future reference.
* **Disaster recovery** — Make Slack part of your disaster-recovery strategy, and backup the contents of critical channels.

## Motivation

A lot of critical knowledge is created and shared on Slack channels.
However, no one is in all channels, nor has the time to read them.
We were missing a way to curate important discussions,
and preserve them.
Conversations saved outside Slack,
could be linked and referenced in other docs and tickets.
This, in turn, would make them more visible and consequential.
